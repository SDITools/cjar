\title{Create the Filter Container}
\usage{
filter_con(
  context = "hits",
  conjunction = "and",
  rules = NULL,
  exclude = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{context}{Defines the level that the filter logic should operate on. Valid
values are visitors, visits, and hits. See Details}

\item{conjunction}{This defines the relationship of the rules.  \code{And} (default)
and \code{or} are the two options.}

\item{rules}{List of rules and/or containers. Must be wrapped in a list() function.
Adding a container list item will nest it within a containers.}

\item{exclude}{Exclude the entire container}
}
\value{
a structured list of containers to be used to build the filter
}
\description{
This function combines rules into a container.
}
\details{
\strong{Context}
The rules in a filter have a context that specify the level of operation.
The context can be visitors, visits or hits.
As an example, let's build a filter rule where revenue is greater than 0 (meaning
a purchase took place) and change the context to see how things change.
If the context is set to 'visitors', the filter includes all hits from visitors
that have a purchase of some kind during a visit. This is useful in analyzing
customer behavior in visits leading up to a purchase and possibly behavior after a purchase.
If the context is set to 'visits', the filter includes all hits from visits where
a purchase occurred. This is useful for seeing the behavior of a visitor in
immediate page views leading up to the purchase.
If the context is set to hit, the filter only includes hits where a purchase
occurred, and no other 'hits.' This is useful in seeing which products were most popular.
In the above example, the context for the container listed is hits. This
means that the container only evaluates data at the hit level, (in contrast
to visit or visitor level). The rows in the container are also at the hit level.
