\usage{
filter_rule(
  dimension = NULL,
  metric = NULL,
  verb = NULL,
  object = NULL,
  description = NULL,
  is_distinct = FALSE,
  attribution = "repeating",
  attribution_context = "visitors",
  validate = FALSE,
  dataviewId = Sys.getenv("CJA_DATAVIEW_ID")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{dimension}{This is the subject of the rule. The value should be the dimension
id. Only the dimension or metric can be used at a time.}

\item{metric}{This is the subject of the rule. The value should be the metric
id.  Only the dimension or metric can be used at a time.}

\item{verb}{Choose from any of the 30 different verbs. Use the \code{\link[=filter_verbs]{filter_verbs()}}
package data to see all available verbs along with the descriptions.}

\item{object}{This is the object of the rule and answers the question \code{what} or \verb{how many}}

\item{description}{The internal description for the rule. (optional) This will
not show in the UI but could be very helpful when using the API.}

\item{is_distinct}{This will filter on a distinct count of items within a dimension.
Examples: “Visitors who viewed more than 5 distinct products,” or “Visits where
more than 5 distinct pages were seen.”}

\item{attribution}{Define the type of attribution. Either \code{repeating} (default),
\code{instance}, or \code{nonrepeating}. See Details for more information.}

\item{attribution_context}{When applying a non-repeating instance attribution model
to a rule the context for the attribution must be \code{visitors} (default) or \code{visits}}

\item{validate}{Set to TRUE when metric or dimension validation is preferred. Default is FALSE.
Validation will slow down the function response time but ensure a valid rule result.}

\item{dataviewId}{CJA data view id.  If an environment variable called \code{CJA_DATAVIEW_ID} exists
in \code{.Renviron} or elsewhere and no \code{dataviewId} argument is provided, then the \code{CJA_DATAVIEW_ID} value will
be used. Use \code{\link[=cja_get_dataviews]{cja_get_dataviews()}} to get a list of available \code{dataviewId}.}

\value{
A structured list defining the rule for a filter

\description{
This function creates the simple rule of a filter.

\details{
\strong{Attribution Models}
Available for dimensions only, these models determine what values in a dimension to filter for.
Dimension models are particularly useful in sequential filter.
\itemize{
\item \emph{repeating} (default): Includes instances and persisted values for the dimension.
\item \emph{instance}: Includes instances for the dimension.
\item \emph{nonrepeating} instance: Includes unique instances (non-repeating) for the dimension. This is the model applied in Flow when repeat instances are excluded.
