## An R Client for the CJA API

Connect to the CJA API, which powers CJA Workspace. The package was developed with the analyst in mind and will continue to be developed with the guiding principles of iterative, repeatable, timely analysis. New features are actively being developed and we value your feedback and contribution to the process. Please submit bugs, questions, and enhancement requests as [issues in this Github repository](https://github.com/searchdiscovery/cjar/issues).
  
### Install the package (recommended)

```
# Install from CRAN
install.packages('cjar')

# Load the package
library(cjar)
```

### Install the development version of the package

```
# Install devtools from CRAN
install.packages("devtools")

# Install adobeanayticsr from github
devtools::install_github('benrwoodard/cjar') 

# Load the package
library(cjar) 
```

### Current setup process overview

**A note about JWT Authentication: Service Account (JWT) credentials have been deprecated in favor of the OAuth Server-to-Server credentials. Your projects using the Service Account (JWT) credentials will stop working after Jan 27, 2025.**

There are four setup steps required to start accessing your Customer Journey Analytics data using Server-to-Server (S2S) OAuth. The following steps are each outlined in greater detail in the following sections:

  1. Create an Adobe Console API Project
  2. Create and add the S2S file link environment variable to your `.Renviron` file.
  3. Get your authorization token by using the function `cja_auth()`.
  4. Get the `Data View ID` by using the function `cja_get_dataviews()`.

#### 1. Create an Adobe Console API Project

When using S2S authentication, you need an Adobe Console API project for each organization you are needing to access.

Once you are a developer for a CJA product profile, you can create an API client in the Adobe Developer Console.

1. Navigate to console.adobe.io.
2. Check the organization name in the top right to make sure that you are logged in to the correct company.
3. Click Create new project.
4. Click Add API.
5. Click Customer Journey Analytics, then click Next.
7. OAuth Server-to-Server should be selected.
8. Click Next.
9. Select "Full CJA Access" 
10. Click Save configured API.
11. Back on the project's home page, click Add to project > API.
12. Click Experience Platform API, then click Next.
13. You already generated a S2S when creating the CJA API, so you do not need to create another. Click Next.
14. Select the desired product profiles for the service account. Make sure that it contains the right permissions to access the API. Click Save configured API.
15. Click on "OAuth Server-to-Server" under "CREDENTIALS" in the left column. Locate the "Download JSON" button on the top right and click it to download the JSON file. Alternatively, you can manually create this file by copying and pasting the Client ID, Client Secret (click “Retrieve client secret”), Technical Account ID, and Organization ID into a `.json` file.  Reference `?cja_auth` for more information on the variables needed. Using the preconfigured JSON file is the easiest method.
16. Locate the JSON file that automatically downloaded in the previous step and move it to your desired location. The location of this file will be needed as the value of the **CJA_AUTH_FILE** variable.


#### 2. Set up the .Renviron file

This file is essential to keeping your information secure. It also speeds up analysis by limiting the number of arguments you need to add to every function call. 

  1. If you do not have an `.Renviron` file (if you have never heard of this file you almost certainly don't have one!), then create a new file and save it with the name `.Renviron`. You can do this from within the RStudio environment and save the file either in your `Home` directory (which is recommended; click on the **Home** button in the file navigator in RStudio and save it to that location) _or_ within your project's working directory. You can also use the ["usethis"](https://usethis.r-lib.org/reference/edit.html) package to create the file by running the function `edit_r_environ(scope = "user")`
  2. Add the variables, listed below, to the `.Renviron` file using the file location path of the JSON file. The format of variables in the `.Renviron` file is straightforward.
  
```
## S2S creds ##
CJA_AUTH_FILE=filelocation.json
```
      
After adding this variable to the `.Renviron` file and saving it, restart your R session (**Session > Restart R** in RStudio) and reload the package (`library(cjar)`). 


#### 3. Get your access token

The token is actually a lonnnnng alphanumeric string that is the what ultimately enables you to access your data:

1. In the console, enter `cja_auth()` and press _Enter_.
2. In the Console window you should see "Successfully authenticated with S2S: access token valid until ...."
3. If you do not see this message then go back and repeat the previous steps to make sure you did not miss something.

#### 4. Get the Data View ID

All data in CJA is located in Data Views, similar to Report Suites in Adobe Analytics. Before pulling data it is essential to locate the data view id you are attempting to pull from.  

```
#Pull a list of available data views

dv <- cja_get_dataviews(expansion = c('name', 'description')) 

#note: see function documentation for all availabe expansion metadata available.
```

Once you have the data view ID you want then you can begin pulling data using the different functions.
