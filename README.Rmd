## An R Client for CJA API

Connect to the CJA API, which powers CJA Workspace. The package was developed with the analyst in mind and will continue to be developed with the guiding principles of iterative, repeatable, timely analysis. New features are actively being developed and we value your feedback and contribution to the process. Please submit bugs, questions, and enhancement requests as [issues in this Github repository](https://github.com/searchdiscovery/cjar/issues).

### Current setup process overview

There are four setup steps required to start accessing your Customer Journey Analytics data. The following steps are each outlined in greater detail in the following sections:

  1. Create an Adobe Console API Project
  2. Create and add the JWT arguments to your `.Renviron` file.
  3. Get your authorization token by using the function `cja_auth()`.
  4. Get the `Data View ID` by using the function `cja_get_dataviews()`.

#### 1. Create an Adobe Console API Project

When using JWT authentication, you only need an Adobe Console API project for each organization you are needing to access.

Once you are a developer for a CJA product profile, you can create an API client in the Adobe Developer Console.

1. Navigate to console.adobe.io.
2. Check the organization name in the top right to make sure that you are logged in to the correct company.
3. Click Create new project.
4. Click Add API.
5. Click Customer Journey Analytics, then click Next.
6. Click Generate Keypair.
7. A config.zip file is automatically downloaded to your local machine. Keep this config folder in a secure location, as it contains your only copy of your private key. See steps ... for what to do with the private.key file.
8. Click Next.
9. Select the desired product profiles for the service account. Make sure that it contains the right permissions to access the API. Click Save configured API.
10. Back on the project's home page, click Add to project > API.
11. Click Adobe Experience Platform, then click Next.
12. You already generated a keypair when creating the Adobe Analytics API, so you do not need to create another. Click Next.
13. Select the desired product profiles for the service account. Make sure that it contains the right permissions to access the API. Click Save configured API.
14. Copy and paste the Client ID, Client Secret (click "Retrieve client secret"), Technical Account ID, and Organization ID and paste them into a .Renviron file in the project or user directory.  
15. Locate the config.zip file that automatically downloaded in step 6. Unzip the file and move the 'private.zip' file into your working directory. The location of this file will be needed as the value of the **CJA_PRIVATE_KEY** variable.


#### 2. Set up the .Renviron file

This file is essential to keeping your information secure. It also speeds up analysis by limiting the number of arguments you need to add to every function call.

  1. If you do not have an `.Renviron` file (if you have never heard of this file you almost certainly don't have one!), then create a new file and save it with the name `.Renviron`. You can do this from within the RStudio environment and save the file either in your `Home` directory (which is recommended; click on the **Home** button in the file navigator in RStudio and save it to that location) _or_ within your project's working directory.
  2. Get the following variables from the CJA project and config.zip file and then add them to the file (see _Creating an Adobe Console API Project_ above)  The format of variables in the `.Renviron` file is straightforward.
  
```
## JWT creds ##
CJA_CLIENT_ID=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
CJA_CLIENT_SECRET=XXX-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
CJA_TECHNICAL_ID=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX@techacct.adobe.com
CJA_ORGANIZATION_ID=XXXXXXXXXXXXX@AdobeOrg

CJA_PRIVATE_KEY=private.key
```
      
After adding all 5 variables to the `.Renviron` file and saving it, restart your R session (**Session > Restart R** in RStudio) and reload `cjar` (`library(cjar)`). 


#### 3. Get your access token

The token is actually a lonnnnng alphanumeric string that is the what ultimately enables you to access your data:

1. In the console, enter `aw_auth()` and press _Enter_.
2. In the Console window you should see "Successfully authenticated with JWT: access token valid until ...."
3. If you do not see this message then go back and repeat the previous steps to make sure you did not miss something.

#### 4. Get the Data View ID

All data in CJA is located in Data Views, similar to Report Suites in Adobe Analytics. Before pulling data it is advisable to locate the data view id of the data you are attempting to pull from.  

```
#Pull a list of available data views

dv <- cja_get_dataviews(expansion = c('name', 'description')) 

#note: see function documentation for all availabe expansion metadata available.
```

Once you have the data view ID you want then you can begin pulling data using the different functions.
