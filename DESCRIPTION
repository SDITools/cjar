Description: Programatically connect and pull data from the 'CJA' API, which powers 'CJA Workspace' <https://github.com/AdobeDocs/cja-apis>. 
             The package was developed with the analyst in mind and will 
             continue to be developed with the guiding principles of iterative, 
             repeatable, timely analysis. New features are actively being 
             developed and we value your feedback and contribution to the process.
